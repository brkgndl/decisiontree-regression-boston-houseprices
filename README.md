# 🏡 Boston House Price Prediction using Decision Tree Regressor

Hi! I'm currently learning machine learning and this is one of my first regression projects. I used the Boston Housing dataset to predict house prices based on various features like crime rate, number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and more.

## 📌 Project Description

In this project, I built a regression model using a Decision Tree Regressor to predict house prices (`MEDV`). I learned how to:

- Load and explore data using pandas
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a regression model
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- Understand feature importances
- Visualize predictions with matplotlib

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

## DATASET
 The data file boston.csv is included in this project folder. I downloaded it from Kaggle, so you don’t need to download anything else. Just run the code and enjoy! (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data?resource=download)

## 📊 Model Performance

- **RMSE**: ~3.33  
- **R² Score**: ~0.84

These results show that the model fits the data quite well!

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How decision trees work for regression
- How to measure model accuracy for regression tasks
- How to interpret feature importance and evaluate results
- How to visualize prediction results

## 🚀 Next Steps

I'm planning to:
- Try other regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Apply cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Improve visualizations and add more insights

## SETUP :
To install the needed libraries, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Thanks for checking out my project! I'm excited to learn more and keep improving. 😊
